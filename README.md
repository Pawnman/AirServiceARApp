## Concept:
The project is an AR-based assistant application designed to assist in technical and service operations on aircraft. This application is intended for both experienced technical specialists and beginners. The application uses an adaptive object tracking method (AR tracking) that combines two methods: marker-based and 3D-model-based tracking.

The application supports two scenarios:
1. Installation of electrical equipment and power supply system components on the aircraft.
2. Pre-flight external inspection of the aircraft.

### User Interface:

## Lifecycle:
1. Launch the application by pressing the "Log In" button on the start screen.
2. A screen with an application description and scenarios, as well as two buttons to navigate to the desired scenario.
3.1 A screen with safety information during electrical installation work on the aircraft's power supply system.
3.2 A screen projecting the location of electrical cables for installation with attachment points. Exit the scenario via the red button.
4.1 A screen with safety information for the pre-flight external inspection of the aircraft.
4.2 A screen projecting key inspection points and using the "CHECK LIST." Exit the scenario via the red button.
